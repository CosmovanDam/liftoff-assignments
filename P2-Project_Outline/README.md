## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We have users that add content into “playlists” through the use of links (also maybe files?) in order to feel or go through certain emotions. These “playlists” would contain a variety of items such as music, videos, images, quotes, etc. (could be full of all of one form of item or diversified to all types). These playlists would be personal and contained within a user profile that requires authentication. Content added by users would be added to the website library for other users to potentially utilize for their playlists as well. Includes limitations for how many items could be placed within a playlist. Have the option to make user profiles private or public to other users.
